# Security Verification Tests (SVTs) in CICD Pipeline

![Security_In_CICD](../Images/Security_In_CICD.jpg)

The Secure Development/CICD Kit components of the AzSDK enable a developer to build a cloud application with security baked in at every stage from design until integration and deployment through various artifacts, tools and automation.  

The following features are currently included:
- 	Build/Release Tasks for CICD workflows  - Integrates security coverage within the VSO CICD pipeline via VSO build/release extensions (tasks) for security verification tests (SVTs) and other security tools. (We also plan to support miniaturized ARM templates which can be combined with existing templates and, subsequently, to analyze 'ARM template equivalence' from a security standpoint.)
